"""Blocking cloud-save helpers for the launch/quit edges — the CARTRIDGE model.

The pet save lives on the lobby server keyed by account (see server.py), and
the server tracks ONE HOLDER device per account: the pet is a cartridge,
checked out to one device at a time.  A non-holding device gets exactly one
question at launch ("Your pet is on phone. Take it onto this device?") and is
otherwise a spectator; the holder plays with no new friction at all.

Why: "newest save wins" decided by wall clock, so an actively-relaunched
device holding a STALE FORK of the pet legitimately out-stamped the real one
— the gen-10 loss (2026-07-27, a desktop's gen-3 over a phone's gen-10) and
the GPD fork war (2026-07-29, twice in one night).  The guard stack built in
0.5.290-293 was cut by 0.5.294's plain-and-simple revert; the cartridge is
its replacement — the one question no algorithm can answer (WHICH copy do
you mean?) goes to the player, once, at the only moment it matters.

Everything here is fail-soft: offline / bad password / timeout simply returns
without syncing, so the game always runs — except a device whose LAST cloud
contact said "another device holds the pet": that one stays a spectator until
it can reach the cloud and take.
